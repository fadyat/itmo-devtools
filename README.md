## Problems

- [Maintaining a Git repository using GitHub](./Problems/lab1.md)

> As an example, you can look at this [repo](https://github.com/ITMO-TECH-TEAM-3/TEAM-3-1).

- [Non-standard operations when working with Git](./Problems/lab2.md)

> [Report](./Solutions/lab2/docs/report.md). In some cases you can do it easier.

- [Project management and documentation systems](./Problems/lab3.md)

> I used some work project, sorry for that :(

- [Exploring IDEs](./Problems/lab4.md)

> My report is [here](./Solutions/lab4/report.md).
>
> Also, some useful docs are [here](./Solutions/lab4), like Goland [shortcuts](./Solutions/lab4/goland-mac.pdf)
>
> It's not so good, but it's too lazy to write it more detailed.

- [Developing a Plugin for an IDE](./Problems/lab5.md)

> I choose JetBrains IDEs, because I use it every day. And hate IDE, that uses Electron.
>
> My awesome plugin is [here](./Solutions/lab5/awesome-plugin/README.md).
>
> It's allows you to make request inside IDE, and get response in IDE, like you do it in Postman.

- [Continuous Integration and Deployment with GitLab](./Problems/lab6.md)

> I was so tired of this lab, that I didn't do it. Sorry for that.
>
> But it's not so hard, you can do it by yourself.
